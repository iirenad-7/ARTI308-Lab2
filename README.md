# ARTI 308 – Lab 2

## Dataset
This project uses the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The dataset consists of 150 samples and 5 columns.

## Problem Type
The machine learning problem is a supervised classification task.

## Target Variable
The target variable in this dataset is the flower species.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Google Colab

## Description
The purpose of this lab is to explore and inspect the dataset, identify the type of machine learning problem, and understand the overall methodology of a machine learning project without training a model.
A methodology diagram is included to illustrate the general workflow.
